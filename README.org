* The Linux Programming Interface with Golang

Following the famous [[https://www.man7.org/tlpi/][The Linux Programming Interface]] book from Michael Kerrisk.
But now in Golang (instead of C).

I started this project to learn:
- more details about how Linux works
- Golang
- something about System Programming (coming from a scripting language background)
- understand C idioms and acronyms by working through the book (C has a simple
  syntax, but many C programs are hard to understand without some practice in
  reading/writing C code)

I choosed Golang as:
- it is easier to understand
- has less gotchas than C (and thus is more practical to program)
- it is the language of Kubernetes and DevOps (both matter to me in my profession)
- it probably is also easier to start into system programming than with Rust

** Structure

I follow the structure of the [[https://www.man7.org/tlpi/code/download/tlpi-200424-dist.tar.gz][Distribution source C source code]].
